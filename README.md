# Noteful Client

Noteful is a note-taking application built using React! I built this application from the ground up utilizing industry best-practices, semantic HTML and a11ly best-practices to write a cohesive and beautiful note-taking application.

## The stack

 Noteful was created using React.js on the front-end complete with integration testing using the Jest and Enzyme libraries.
 
 Routing was handled with ReactRouter, an elegant solution to web page navigation.
 
 Icons were added using the FontAwesome library, and fonts were managed with the Google Fonts API.
 
 I also coded the back-end server using Express.js, and Mocha and Chai for integration testing.
